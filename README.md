**Deep Brain Stimulation in Parkinson Disease: a meta-analysis of the long-term neuropsychological outcomes  (Madalina Bucur and Costanza Papagno)**

**Abstract**

Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or globus pallidum internus (GPi) improves motor functions in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) but may cause a decline in specific cognitive domains.

Objective: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the long-term (1-3 years) effects of STN or GPi DBS on four cognitive functions: (i) memory (delayed recall), (ii) executive functions – inhibition control (color-word Stroop test) and flexibility (phonemic verbal fluency), (iii) language (semantic verbal fluency), and (iv) mood (anxiety and depression).

Methods: Medline and Web of Science were searched and studies published before July 2021 investigating long-term changes in PD patients following DBS were included. Random-effects model meta-analyses were performed using the R software to estimate the standardized mean difference (SMD) computed as Hedges’ g with 95% CI.

Results: 2522 publications were identified, 48 of which satisfying the inclusion criteria. Fourteen meta-analyses were performed including 2039 adults with a clinical diagnosis of PD undergoing DBS surgery and 271 PD controls.

Conclusion(s): Our findings add new information to the existing literature, by demonstrating that, at a long follow-up interval (1/3 years), both positive, such as a mild improvement in anxiety and depression, and negative effects, such as a decrease of long-term memory, verbal fluency, and specific subdomains of executive functions, are observed. The level of evidence as qualified with GRADE varied from low for the pre- vs. post - analysis to medium when compared to a control group.
